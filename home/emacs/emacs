;;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! EVEN IN THE GIT REPO!
;;;
;;; TL;DR: If you need to "change .emacs", put the changes in site-lisp/emacs_include.el.
;;;
;;; This is because all kinds of stuff gets auto-appended to .emacs. Updates in the git repo
;;; cause $HOME/.emacs to get overwritten, and those auto-changes get wiped out.
;;;
;;; Ergo, the 'real' .emacs file is kept as change-free as possible; it contains just enough
;;; boilerplate to load and include $HOME/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs_include.
