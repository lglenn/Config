;; Machine-specific config for org mode
;; needs to define the following variables:
;; gtd-directory: path to the directory that holds gtd files
;; work-directory: path to the directory that holds work files
;; personal-directory: path to the directory that holds personal files
;; roam-directory: path to the directory where org-roam files live
;; directory names need to end with a trailing slash

;; example:
;; (setq gtd-directory "~/gtd/")
;; (setq work-directory "~/work/")
;; (setq personal-directory "~/docs/")
;; (setq roam-directory "~/roam/")
